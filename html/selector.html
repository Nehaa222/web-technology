With his wife Ugur Atabek, and business partner Jim Thomas, Atabek formed Mindcraft Software to publish his next game, The Magic Candle.[2] By 1993 the company was publishing six titles a year and had about 30 employees.[3] The company's games were primarily developed for DOS systems, but they also developed games for Apple II, Commodore 64, and Amiga computers. The company developed 15 games between 1989 and 1997.</p></div>
